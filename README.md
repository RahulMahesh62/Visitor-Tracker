When visiting a public place during these Covid times, are you tired to stand in a queue just to give your details? Have you ever wondered how to make this process more efficient?

Then you've reached the correct destination. We're presenting you a solution with our mobile application **VisitorTracker**.

* Share your details in a fast and efficient way using QR Codes.
* As an Admin, collect visitor details with ease and store them digitally. 
* In case of any positive cases at your place, inform all the visitors using push notifications.

Do try out the application by creating an account. We assure you that **VisitorTracker** would give you a new experience and thus ease your efforts.
